Name <- "Louie LeChat"
weight <- 9.65
age <- 8

cat(sprintf("Hello, my name is %s. I am %d years old and weigh %f pounds", 
        Name, age, weight))

## Notice that in the output, the weight appears with more 
## than 2 decimal places.
## We can control the number of decimal places by including 
## additional in information as part of the "%f". 

## Your turn!
## Copy the line that prints the statement to the screen and replace
## "%f" with "%.2f".  Can you describe what the ".2" does to the 
## output of the number?


## Again, your turn!
## Modify the output so that only one decimal place is shown for 
## weight.
