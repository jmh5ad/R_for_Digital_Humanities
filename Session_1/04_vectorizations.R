## Example 1:  Vectorization with numbers
x <- 1:5
y <- 2*x

print(x)
print(y)


## There are other operations that can be performed
## on vectors.  You may want to sum the list of numbers
## or find the mean and standard deviation.
## We have **functions**that can perform these operations.
## We'll learn more about functions in a little bit.
## But for now, uncomment (i.e., remove the "#" at the 
## start of the line) and run each of the following lines:

#print("Looking at different vector operations")
#print(x)

#x_sum <- sum(x)
#print(x_sum)

#x_mean <- mean(x)
#print(x_mean)
 
#x_sd <- sd(x)
#print(x_sd)
